## WordPress theme made with WP Rig
I followed a Linkedin Learning course on how to create WordPress themes with WP Rig.
WP Rig is a modern build process and starter theme bundled into one convenient package, it's very customizable and very easy to work with.
here is a link to their Github https://github.com/wprig/wprig/.
## What i added to the theme
I added a footer widget and a widget for related posts (posts in same category).
